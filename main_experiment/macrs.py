(2) When the recommended movie does not match {target movie information}, you need to indicate which aspect of it does not align with {target movie information}.
Please note that you do not need to provide specific information from {target movie information}, but rather indicate which aspect of it does not meet the expectations (such as director, era, genre, etc.) using vague information.
The recommended movie in {browsing history}, you should say you've seen these movies in the past. Furthermore, when the recommended movie overlaps with the target movie information, you should point it out.

In system response 2, I recommend "The Matrix", and it meets part of user preferences. However, the user rejected the recommendation because the user is looking for movies directed by Ron. Next, I should recommend movies directed by Ron.

{action trajectory}:
user preference 1: The user wants an animated movie with a relaxing and romantic storyline from the production company Disney.
system response 1: How about "Zootopia"? This is a romantic comedy animated film produced by Disney.
user utterance 1: I have seen "Zootopia" and I love Disney. Can you suggest something else?
